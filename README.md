# Bike Sales Analysis

### Objective : 
The Aim of this project is to analyse bike sales data using Microsoft Excel. 

### Dataset :
The dataset used for this analysis contains information about the sales of bikes in various regions around the world.

### Analysis : 

The purpose of this analysis is to gain insights into the sales trends of different bike types and regions. Here in this project, I have used Microsoft Excel to create charts and tables that will help to visualize and interpret the data.

To view this project you could go to the file "Bike Sales Analysis.xlsx". It contains the dataset as well as the Dashboard. 

Data has been cleaned before using it which is stored in "Work sheet" and the tables are present in "PivotTable" sheet. {Both of which are hidden.}

Thank you :)
